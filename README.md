# Uline-App
The non-dev folder was just messing around through some online tutorials. Everything that is intended to actually work for a purpose will be in the dev branch.

For now, the Django routing works with rider.html as the homepage.

If you want to work on the actual app, the html files are in dev/dotTracker/templates/dt, any js files that they will reference will be in dev/dotTracker/static/dt.

The Django wrapper should be good for the purposes of the MVP, we can leave it for now.
